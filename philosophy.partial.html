            <div class="philosophy-description__container">
                <p>We believe that bread, especially handmade and healthy bread, deserves great respect. Respect for the
                    land, for
                    our local farmers who raise and gather in the crops, and for bakers who bake bread by hand for us to
                    enjoy at
                    the table every day. From land to a table, bread is a symbol of our life cycle. We are passionate
                    about creating
                    nutritious and healthy bread to support your healthy lifestyle.</p>
