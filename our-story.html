                            methods that offer unique flavors and textures. Our range of hand-crafted bread includes
                            varieties from all over the world and is designed according to high-quality industry
                            standards. We use our natural sourdough in each type of our bread. We never take shortcuts
                            for our processes since that is how we achieve that irresistible freshness and taste.

                <h3 class="about-story__intro">WarmBread Bakery was founded in Autumn, 2016</h3>
                <p class="about-story__text">The idea of creating WarmBread came about when we lived and worked as bakers
                    in Chicago, Illinois. Our story starts with us, with how we met, what we did and learned, and now
                    you are a part of it.
                </p>
                <p class="about-story__text">Our very first meeting at our BA in Culinary Arts in 2011 marked the
                    beginning of our journey. We were sitting next to each other at the open baking workshop and have
                    not left each other ever since. WarmBread is the apex of eight years of work as cooks who have now
                    become bakers â€“ collecting innovative and creative ideas, sharing skills, food recipes, and our true
                    passion to feed people with the food made with love and care.
                </p>
                <p class="about-story__text">While in Chicago, we acquired priceless skills and practice by working
                    closely with the best bakers in the industry. Jane worked under the direction of Nicholas Janko at
                    TG Bread&Butter, and Charlotte joined the Craftsmen&Wolves crew led by Willy Burner and Elizabeth
                    Ballock.
                </p>

                    <img src="img/bakers-hands.jpg" alt="bakers hands" class="hands">
                </div>
                <p class="about-story__text">We moved to London, UK and opened WarmBread Bakery. Our small bakery began
                    its journey on a small farm. Since then, we have moved to a more spacious place that we believed
                    will bring us closer to our mutual dream of creating a local bakery.
                </p>                
                <p class="about-story__text">Now, we make every effort to find natural ingredients anywhere we can,
                    ranging from growing organic products in the countryside to collecting products from our small
                    organic backyard at home and establishing partnerships with local producers.
                </p>
                <p class="about-story__text">Seasonal food is an important principle in creating our new menus. In summer,
                    for instance, you will find more local berries and rhubarb in our meals. As we approach autumn,
                    there will be more stoned fruits and blackberries. Then we will offer pears, apples, and quinces to
                    prepare for the winter.
                </p>
                <div class="about-story__img img-2">

                </div>
                <p class="about-story__text">At WarmBread, we specialize primarily on baking breads and flaky pastries. We
                    bake fresh produce each day. All our products are made by hand using a sourdough, which ensures a
                    slow fermentation process. We mix the sourdough starter on day one, mix and shape it the next day,
                    then bake to turn these simple ingredients on the third day. This approach to baking requires the
                    highest level of commitment. We always strive for exceptional baking, delicacy, and client
                    satisfaction.
                </p>
                <p class="about-story__text">Although it is worth waiting, nothing can be compared with the flavor, that
                    tempting crust and custard of our sourdough, or the smell of fresh-baked butter croissants stuffing
                    the bakery.
                </p>
                <p class="about-story__text">We are looking forward to baking our breads for you! </p>
